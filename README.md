Project Description

1.Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator Requirement: Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows:

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

Solution: if else statement is used to compare given marks and output grades based on marks entered.

2.Challenge 2: Speed Detector Requirement: Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Solution: if else statement is used to compare given speed and output total points accumulated in every speed range and issue demerit points when speed is exceeded

3.Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the NSSF Deductions, net salary, Payee Tax and NHIF.

Solution: After declaring variables, if else statement is used to compare given deductions and output a net salary
